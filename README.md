# Image Processing Domino Detection

This project demonstrates various image processing techniques in MATLAB for detecting dominoes in images. The focus is on color-based object detection, edge detection, and the use of morphological operations to enhance detection accuracy.

## Features

- **Color-based Masking**: Detects dominoes using specific RGB color ranges.
- **Grayscale Conversion & Binary Processing**: Converts the processed image to grayscale and applies binary operations.
- **Edge Detection**: Uses Sobel gradient operators to identify edges and contours.
- **Morphological Operations**: Applies erosion, dilation, and other techniques to clean the binary image and detect dominoes more accurately.
- **Noise Reduction**: Applies median filtering to reduce noise in the final output.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

You need to have MATLAB installed on your machine. The project uses built-in MATLAB functions for image processing.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/houcineHAM/Image-Processing-Domino-Detection.git
   ```
2. Open the project folder in MATLAB.

### Running the Project

1. Load the image in the project directory (make sure you replace `'img.jpg'` with the correct image filename).
2. Run the `Image_Processing_Domino_Detection.m` script to process the image and detect the dominoes.

### Example Output

The script will generate three main outputs:
- **Original Image**
- **Image with Mask**
- **Processed Image (Final Output)**

## Usage

This project is mainly designed for detecting dominoes using specific color properties in an image. You can adjust the RGB values and tolerance to fit other color-based object detection scenarios.
